# Body Measurement Protocol (Tape-Based)

## General Rules (Apply to All Measurements)

- Use a flexible cloth or fiberglass measuring tape
- Measure directly against skin (or very thin clothing)
- Stand upright, feet shoulder-width apart
- Relax muscles; do not flex or “brace”
- Tape should be snug but **not compressing tissue**
- Record to the nearest 0.1 unit (cm or in)
- Measure each site **twice** and record the average
- Perform measurements at the same time of day when possible
